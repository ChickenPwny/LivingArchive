## Privacy Policy for LivingArchive Security Research Platform

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025
**Effective Date:** October 19, 2025

### 1. Introduction

The LivingArchive Security Research Platform ("LivingArchive," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all data processed through our AI-powered cybersecurity research and automation platform. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information, focusing on our operational commitment to retain necessary research data while safeguarding sensitive information.

### 2. Information We Collect and Retain

We collect and **indefinitely retain** the following data, as necessary for the core functions of security research, AI training, and system optimization.

* **Platform Research Data:** Target domains for authorized testing, security scan results, vulnerability intelligence (CVE data, threat intelligence), network topology, and evidence files (screenshots, proof-of-concept files). **Retention: Indefinite for research integrity.**
* **AI Learning & Model Data:** Programming code patterns, security research methodologies and results, machine learning models, training datasets, and aggregated behavioral patterns for system optimization. **Retention: Indefinite for model improvement and progression.**
* **System Technical Data:** Application logs, error reports, performance metrics, database records (PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB), and API usage statistics. **Retention: Indefinite for system reliability, compliance, and historical auditing.**
* **Access & Authentication Data:** User credentials and access tokens are collected strictly for service provision and securely managed with encryption and role-based access controls.

### 3. How We Use Information

Information is used solely to execute the platform's function, ensuring the highest level of security research and technological advancement:
* **Security Research:** Conducting authorized penetration testing, analyzing vulnerability patterns, and generating AI-enhanced security research reports.
* **AI System Enhancement:** Training and optimizing our AI personalities (L, Luna, Nero, Oak, Surge, Bugsy) to improve autonomous security testing, threat detection, and analysis capabilities.
* **Service Operations:** Providing cybersecurity research services, maintaining system performance, generating reports, and supporting customer security objectives.

### 4. Data Storage, Security, and Retention Commitment

We maintain a robust storage architecture (including PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, Elasticsearch, MinIO, and InfluxDB) protected by high-standard security measures:
* **Security Measures:** All data is protected via **encryption in transit and at rest**, multi-factor authentication, strict Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC), private networks, and comprehensive audit logging.
* **Retention Commitment:** Unlike standard retention policies, LivingArchiveâ€™s core value is the creation of a **Living Archive** of security knowledge. Therefore, all research, AI learning, and technical data are retained **indefinitely** to maintain the integrity of our models, ensure long-term intelligence, and comply with the continuous demands of security research.

### 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We strictly limit sharing to authorized entities under confidential agreements and security protocols. **We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer information to unauthorized parties.** Sharing is limited to:
* **Authorized Personnel:** Our internal security researchers and operational staff.
* **Customer Organizations:** Authorized representatives of the customer domains undergoing testing.
* **Legal Authorities:** When mandated by applicable law or legal process.

### 6. AI Personalities and Processing Safeguards

Our AI systems process data only for authorized security research purposes:
* **AI Personalities:** Systems like L, Luna, Nero, Oak, Surge, and Bugsy process data for code analysis, vulnerability detection, and research coordination.
* **Processing Safeguards:** Personal information is **anonymized or de-identified** before AI processing, and all AI system activities are logged and auditable.

### 7. User Rights, Compliance, and Contact

Users may exercise their rights (Access, Correction, Deletion, Portability, Objection) by contacting the appropriate platform administrative channel. Our legal basis for processing relies on **Legitimate Interest** (security research), **Contract Performance** (fufilling agreements), and **Legal Obligation** (regulatory compliance). We adhere to global standards including GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2, and ISO 27001.
